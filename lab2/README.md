## Substituting V->e ; W->t 
I found a few cases of t_e:tQe. 

## Substituting T-> a
I found a string "Tt T". I posited that the only valid string would be "at a"

## Substituting N -> o:
I found a few instances of "tN" like "tN the". It only makes sense for N to be o

## Substituting P -> s
haP is probably has

## Substituting X -> i
"Xs" appears very often, as a word and within others. I reckon X is i.

## O -> d
"saiO" is probably said. it could be sail, and l and d have similar frequency.

## R -> w
"he Ras" is probably "he was".

## F -> y ; I -> r
"at $4,500 a FeaI" is probably "year".

## G -> n
"Gew jersey" has to be "new jersey"

## C -> f ; J -> g ; Z -> m
"one oC his Cirst assiJnZents" is probably "one of his first assignments"

## U -> p
"of the war deUartment"

## K -> v
"to proKe or disproKethe" is obviously "to prove or disprove the". The text has a few such mistakes where space is missing between word.

## H -> c
"existenHe of Hiphers" -> "existance of ciphers"

## S -> l
"the signaS schooS" -> "the signal school"

## D -> u ; A -> B
"his repDtation. ADt in fact it was only the Aeginning." ->
"his reputation. "

## L -> k
"he titled his booL elements of cryptanalysis" -> "he titled his book elements of 
cryptanalysis"
Also k is the last letter anyways.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, as a result of realizing this laboratory, I have learned how to decypher any cypher that is
done by simply changing one letter of the alphabet to another, by exploating the natural frequency of appearance
of letters in the English language. By looking at the number of the letters in the text, I matched them with 
the probability in english and swapped them. While analyzing the output, I started detecting patterns of letters
that form sensible english frases only if a particular letter is substituted. By continuing this process I have decoded the text.

## Decoded text:
riverbank publication no. 22, written in 1920 when friedman was28, must be regarded as the most 
important single publication incryptology. it took the science into a new world. entitled 
the index ofcoincidence and its applications in cryptography, it described thesolution 
of two complicated cipher systems. friedman, however, was lessinterested in proving their 
vulnerability than he was in using them as avehicle for new methods of cryptanalysis.in it, 
friedman devised two new techniques. one was brilliant. itpermitted him to reconstruct a 
primary cipher alphabet without havingto guess at a single plaintext letter. but the other 
was profound. for thefirst time in cryptology, friedman treated a frequency distribution as 
anentity, as a curve whose several points were causally related, not as justa collection of 
individual letters that happen to stand in a certain orderfor noncausal (historical) reasons, 
and to this curve he applied statisticalconcepts. the results can only be described as 
promethean, forfriedman's stroke of genius inspired the numerous, varied, and 
vitalstatistical tools that are indispensable to the cryptology of today.before friedman, 
cryptology eked out an existence as a study untoitself, as an isolated phenomenon, neither 
borrowing from norcontributing to other bodies of knowledge. frequency counts, 
linguisticcharacteristics, kasiski examinations—all were peculiar and particular 
tocryptology. it dwelt a recluse in the world of science. friedman ledcryptology out of this 
lonely wilderness and into the broad rich domain ofstatistics. he connected cryptology to 
mathematics. the sense ofexpanding horizons must have resembled that felt by chemists 
whenfriedrich wohler synthesized urea, demonstrating that life processesoperate under well known chemical laws and are therefore subject toexperimentation and control, and leading to 
today's vast strides inbiochemistry. when friedman subsumed cryptanalysis under 
statistics, he likewise flung wide the door to anarmamentarium to which cryptology had never 
before had access. itsweapons—measures of central tendency and dispersion, of fit 
andskewness, of probability and sampling and significance—were ideallyfashioned to deal with 
the statistical behavior of letters and words.cryptanalysts, seizing them with alacrity, 
have wielded them withnotable success ever since.this is why friedman has said, in looking 
back over his career, thatthe index of coincidence was his greatest single creation. it alone 
wouldhave won him his reputation. but in fact it was only the beginning. he and mrs. friedman 
quit riverbank near the end of 1920. thesituation had become intolerable. fabyan had lured him 
back after thewar with raises and promises of absolute freedom to prove or disprovethe 
existence of ciphers in shakespeare. but he had squelched everyattempt to do so and had 
embarrassed friedman into apparentlyacquiescent silence at lantern-slide lectures on the 
subject. on january1, 1921, friedman began a six-month contract with the signal corps 
todevise cryptosystems. when it expired, he was taken on the civil-servicepayroll of the war 
department at $4,500 a year.one of his first assignments was to teach a course in military 
codesand ciphers at the signal school, then at camp alfred vail, new jersey.for this he wrote 
a textbook that, for the first time, imposed order uponthe chaos of cipher systems and their 
terminology. these had sproutedin a bewildering variety, and writers treated each as individual 
andspecial cases. friedman sorted them out on the basis of structureinstead of aspect, and 
so logical and useful was this classification that ithas become standard. he modeled his 
nomenclature on his categories, sothat the names he minted have the great merit of making the 
relationsbetween the various genera of ciphers evident on sight. an example is 
thecomplementary pair "mono-alphabet" and "polyalphabet"; the frenchwere still calling 
polyalphabetic systems by the almost obfuscatory"double substitution," which tells 
absolutely nothing at all about thesystem. friedman's most important coinage was the 
word"cryptanalysis," which he devised in 1920 to clear up a chronic source ofconfusion in 
cryptology—the ambiguity of the verb "decipher," then usedto mean both authorized and 
unauthorized reductions of a cryptogram to plaintext.he titled his book elements of 
cryptanalysis, and the term has soprospered that today it circulates in general conversation 
and print.
